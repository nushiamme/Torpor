The code is organized by data type into 3 scripts, for 1. respirometry plots, 2. temperature plots, and 3. phylogenetic corrections and MCMCglmm models. Figures not listed here were conceptual figures made in powerpoint.

* *Torpor_respirometry_plots.R* - Contains code for 
    + Figure 3: VO2 for broad-billed hummingbirds showing inflection point at 14-15 degC
    + Supplementary Figure S5: Duration of torpor per individual per night, as a function of the hour of entry
    + Supplementary Figure S6: Average hourly torpid energy savings relative to normothermy
    + Supplementary Figure S7: Average mass-corrected energy expenditure as a function of minimum hourly chamber temperature
    + Supplementary Figure S9: Total nighttime energy expenditure including rewarming (small black dots), and excluding rewarming (coloured dots), as a function of individual mass

* *Torpor_temperature_plots.R* - Contains code for
    + Figure 2: Chamber Temp plots by hour, per site
    + Electronic supplementary material, Figure S3: Ambient temp plots by hour, per site
    
* *Torpor_phylo_MCMCglmm_models.R* - Contains code for all the MCMCglmm models, and the following plots
